## Overview

I saw some cool themes on a [terminal emulator](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) and decided to re-create them using CSS in a Fallout style terminal.

The goal is to eventually build a full terminal game/puzzle using this UI.

## Features
- Monitor vignette
- Background grain animation
- Scanline
- Custom fonts
- Each theme has own variation of colors, vignette, scanline, and fonts.
